# Cat-Dog-Image-Classifier-using-CNN

## Project Description

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying images of cats and dogs. The dataset consists of images labeled as either cats or dogs, sourced from [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dZvL1gi5QLwOGrfdn9XEsi4EnXx535bD).
